# KTaNE Files

These files are to be used for setting up [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com) on a new computer. Before copying these files, launch the game and choose to disable mods, then complete mission 1.3 to unlock mods.

On Linux, either copy or symlink these files to `~/.config/unity3d/Steel Crate Games/Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes/`.

On Windows, replace every instance of `/home/kasra/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/341800/` with `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\341800\`. in [modSettings.xml](modSettings.xml). Then, either copy or move these files to `%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Steel Crate Games\Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes\`.

## Setting Up Mods

Subscribe to all of [these workshop items](https://steamcommunity.com/id/objectscountries/myworkshopfiles/?browsesort=myfavorites&browsefilter=myfavorites&p=1&numperpage=30&sortmethod=alpha) after unlocking mods. Assuming the mod settings have been placed properly, Tweaks should start downloading every modded module. In order to use the [Dynamic Mission Generator](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1633427044), you must create an empty folder called `ModProfiles` (with that capitalization) in the same directory as everything else.

# IMPORTANT!

**DELETE (Windows) `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\341800\2956286392\` OR (Linux) `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/341800/2956286392/`! This module, Yoshi Egg 2, is an April Fools mod that acts more like a virus than a module.** See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvfD5rnkTws) for more info.
