# Minecraft

My preferred launcher is [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org), and my preferred mod loader is [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net). My skin is Classic as opposed to Slim, and uses the [Home Cape](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Home_Cape). My Minecraft username is `ObjectsCountries` on Java Edition (NameMC page [here](https://namemc.com/profile/ObjectsCountries.1)).

## Mods

* [CraftPresence](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/craftpresence) (**Requires [UniLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unilib)**) for Discord rich presence
* [Cubes Without Borders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cubes-without-borders) for borderless windowed mode

These mods will work with Forge, NeoForge, Fabric and Quilt. CraftPresence is also compatible with Risugami's ModLoader.
